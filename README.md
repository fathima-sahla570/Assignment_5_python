# Assignment_5_python
In this assignment, we explore two fundamental concepts in Python: File Handling and Exception Handling.

File Handling allows us to work with files—reading from and writing to them. It is essential for handling external data, logs, configurations, and reports.
Exception Handling ensures our programs run smoothly even when unexpected errors occur. By using try-except blocks, we can catch and manage errors instead of crashing the program.
Assignment Overview
This assignment consists of 7 exercises, covering different aspects of file operations and exception handling:

Reading a file – Open a file and display its contents.
Copying a file – Copy the contents of one file to another.
Counting words in a file – Read a file and count the number of words.
String to integer conversion – Convert user input to an integer using try-except.
Checking for negative numbers – Raise an exception if a list contains negative numbers.
Computing the average – Handle exceptions while calculating the average of numbers.
Writing to a file – Handle file writing errors and display a welcome message if successful.
By completing these exercises, you will gain hands-on experience with file I/O operations, exception handling, and writing robust Python programs that handle errors gracefully.
